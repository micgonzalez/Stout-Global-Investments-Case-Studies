# Stout-Global-Investments-Case-Studies


# Introduction
This repository is based on Stout Global Investments' Case Studies. These case studies will have two projects that will include analyses and visualizations of the data. 


# Abstract
The following areas of this repository will discuss and explain the objectives of these case studies. More details will be discussed in each section of the case studies guidelines. The general idea of these case studies are to find useful insights based on anonymous financial data from two different data sources.

## Case Study One Guidelines
The dataset contains synthetic transactions and some transactions are marked as fraudulent. We would like you to perform the following using the language of your choice:

• Describe the dataset and any issues with it.
• Generate a minimum of 5 visualizations using the data and write a brief description of your observations. 
• Create a feature set and perform prediction of fraudulent transactions using at least 2 algorithms. Describe any data cleansing that must be performed.
• Visualize the test results and propose what could be done to improve results. Also describe assumptions you made and your approach.



## Case Study Two Guidelines
The dataset has 3 years worth of customer orders. There are 4 columns in the dataset: index, customer_email, net_revenue, and year.

For this dataset we need the following:

• Cleanse any data
• Total customer revenue for each year.
• New customer revenue for each year.
• Existing customer revenue growth for each year.
• Existing customer revenue for each year.
• Existing customer revenue for each prior year.
• Revenue lost from customer attrition for each year.
• Total customers for each year.
• New customers for each year.
• Lost customers for each year.

Additionally, we need 3 visualizations for the data which tell a story about the data. We would like to see the below visualizations:

• Breakdown of order ranges between years (e.g. pie chart of year 1 with orders showing percentages of orders <10$). Groupings should be meaningful.
• Bar chart or another visualization showing revenue lost/gained for existing customers and new customers.
• Bar chart or another visualization showing patterns of new vs existing customers purchase patterns based on groupings from the first visualization.
